### `Copilot`
---
 #### Control + J will trigger Copilot to accept the currently suggested code completion
---
### `Fugitive`
---
 Neovim configuration sets up the **vim-fugitive** plugin for Git integration. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **`<leader>gs`**: Opens the Git command interface.

2. **Autocommand Group**: 
   - When entering a buffer with the filetype `fugitive`, it sets up additional key mappings:
     - **`<leader>p`**: Executes `git push`.
     - **`<leader>P`**: Executes `git pull --rebase`.
     - **`<leader>t`**: Prompts for branch tracking during push.

3. **Diff Commands**:
   - **`gu`**: Gets changes from the second version.
   - **`gh`**: Gets changes from the third version. 

 These mappings enhance Git workflow directly within Neovim.

 The `mapping` configuration sets up key bindings for the completion menu in Neovim using `nvim-cmp` during insert mode. Here's what each key does:

- **`<C-p>`**: Selects the previous completion item.
- **`<C-n>`**: Selects the next completion item.
- **`<C-y>`**: Confirms the selected completion item (if chosen).
- **`<C-Space>`**: Opens the completion menu to show suggestions.

### `Neo-test`
---
The code snippet sets up a key mapping in Neovim that allows you to run tests using the **Neotest** plugin. Here's what it does:

- **`<leader>tc`**: When you press this key combination in normal mode, it executes the `neotest.run.run()` function, which triggers the running of the current test or all tests associated with the current file.

This mapping makes it convenient to quickly run tests during development.

### `Snippets`
---
This code snippet configures the **LuaSnip** plugin in Neovim, allowing for snippet expansion and navigation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

###  `Telescope`
---
This code configures the **Telescope** plugin in Neovim, enhancing file searching and navigation capabilities. Key mappings are established:

- **`<leader>pf`**: Opens a file finder.

### `Undo tree`
---
**UndoTree** is a Neovim plugin that visualizes the undo history of your edits in a tree-like structure. It allows you to see all changes made to a file, including branching paths for when changes are undone and redone. This visual representation helps users navigate through their editing history easily, enabling them to restore previous states or understand the sequence of edits more effectively. Overall, it enhances the standard undo functionality by providing a clearer overview of changes.

 It creates a key mapping:

- **`<leader>u`**: Toggles the display of the undo tree, allowing you to visualize and navigate through the history of changes made in your files.

 This feature helps in efficiently managing and reverting changes.
